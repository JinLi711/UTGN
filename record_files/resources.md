# Data

* [Protein Structure Prediction Center](http://predictioncenter.org/)
    * initiates the CASP experiments to challenge researchers to predict protein structures.
    * contains data on proteins. Contains PDB files.

* [CAMEO](https://www.cameo3d.org/)
    * a place for evaluating the accuracy of protein predictions

* [Dunbrack Lab](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/PISCES.php)
    * great for getting a list of PDB IDs with certain conditions (like within a resolution cutoff)

* [RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/#Subcategory-download_structures)
    * for downloading PDB files
